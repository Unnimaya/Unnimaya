     <p class="dec">This is the standard Fricano's EBA Pizza fresh from the oven. The Everything But Anchovies (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushroom & Green Pepper) or better known to many as the "EBA". Customers of over 30 years still think that it's the only style we make because it is such a popular request. But there are other options. Any combination of the five toppings will result in just a little variation from the other but always the unique and delicious Fricano's pizza taste.</p>
